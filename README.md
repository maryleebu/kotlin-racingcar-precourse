# Woowa Precourse - Car racing game built in Kotlin

### Description

- User-defined number of race rounds
- Random movement (cars move forward if random number between 0 and 9 ≥ 4, otherwise stay still)
- Visual race progress per round
- Supports multiple winners in case of a tie
- Input validation with meaningful error handling (no external termination calls)
- Fully implemented in Kotlin 1.9.24 following Kotlin coding conventions
